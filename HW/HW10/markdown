Initialized a new arrraylist to store the levelorder traversal. I then check to see if the tree is empty. Then creatd a new linked list for the traveral of the binary tree. Inside the while look the tree is being traversed. We iterate through each level of the tree till everything in the tree has been traversed. Then we add the curentLevel list which has the values of the nodes at the current level to the result list.
