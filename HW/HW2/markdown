I made a while loop that runs while beginning is less than end. I start the loop with giving a middle value from my beginning and end value that i created. I then check if that middle value is a bad version. If it is a bad version, I change the value of end to the middle value so that the earlier version is checked. If it is not a bad version then the value of beginning is changed to go to a later version. This goes on until the first bad version is found.
