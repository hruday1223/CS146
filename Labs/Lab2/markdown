I started out by getting rid of the spaces in the 2 strings. I then compared their lengths to see if they were the same. If they were they would move on to be further checked, if not it would print false. Next I created 2 for loops, and an if statement to iterate through the strings and check if any of the characters matched between the 2 strings. Everytime that they did match, I added one to a counter. I then compared the counter with the length of the string, and if it matched it would print true.
