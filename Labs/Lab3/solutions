Problem 1:
1) 10000000000n2 vs n3
	n^3 is asymptotically greater than 10000000000n2. Due n being to the power of 3, it grows exponentially larger than 10000000000n2.

2) n2 log(n) vs n(log(n))10
 n(log(n))10 is asymptotically greater than n2 log(n) because it has the higher power allowing it to grow faster.


3) n(logn) vs 2 root(n)
N log(n) is asymptotically greater than 2 root (n). Even though the square root of n would be larger than log n, the constant n in n(logn) allows it to grow faster than 2 root(n)


4) 2^(n) vs 2^(2n)
2^(2n) is asymptotically greater because the exponent of 2 would be doubled the exponent of 2^n. This allows it to grow faster


Problem 2:
Best Case: 
The best case is when  n is  equal to 5. Since it is a prime number and is greater than 4, it only goes through the loop once.
Worst Case:
The worst case is when n isn’t a prime number, having to make the loop run many times.
Average Case: 
The average case is when n isn’t a prime number but after a number of iterations it hits.
