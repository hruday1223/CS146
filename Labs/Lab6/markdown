Created an adjacency list to essentially represent the graph. Each of the indexes would show  the course and the list at each index would show the courses that needs to be taken. A couple arrays are created to track the nodes. We then perform DFS on each of the nodes. We use another method to actually dp rhw dfs traversal on the graph. We ensure that all the prereqs are met before attempting to take a course.
